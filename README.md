JOKERS is a fun full-stack RESTful application that uses Golang, Javascript, JQuery, and a PostgreSQL database.

To use the application, you need to create the database using the provided SQL schema file.

To run it, use the command `go run main.go`. From here, point your browser to `http://localhost:3000/`. This will take you to a login page which includes the ability to create a new account. Create an account and login. From the home page, you have the ability to generate random jokes, generate jokes that are personalized with the name you used to create your account, or generate custom jokes using a name that you provide. Feel free to play around with these features or check out the standard Contact, About, etc. pages included in the navigation.

Have fun!
